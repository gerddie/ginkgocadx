224.0.0.0 - 239.0.0.0 is our LAN!

pinging it pings all the hosts
while pinging 255.255.255.255 pings only BSD (Win32 no response to bcast ping)

Does this mean my Linksys BEFSR81 supports multicast? I think so.
It supports multicast pass-through also.
But how can I join a group? I suppose I have to join before I can actually
receive. This is very inefficient if the kernel has to drop mcast packets
not intended for it, the router should only forward to group members. But
does it? Not sure.

Multicast is neat, use it.

But why I can ping 232.0.0.0 - 232.255.255.255, though RFC 3171 says its
RESERVED? Heck, why can I ping the WHOLE MULTICAST range?
224.0.0.0 - 239.0.0.0

nmap reveals they're not running TCP. Makes sense...its not multicastable.
UDP is.

Warning: forward host lookup failed for reserved-multicast-range-NOT-delegated.example.com: Unknown host

Interesting. "Address family not supported by protocol family"

nmap says all UDP and TCP are filtered. But ICMP isn't!

However, a protocol scan (-sO) shows that icmp,tcp,and udp (1,6,17) are 
supported. None other of the 256 possible IP protocols are. Good.

All hosts appear identical.
