# Ginkgo CADx #

## Preface ##

* Currently the project is maintained on a voluntary basis. 
* There is no PRO version.
* I can't help you with compiling this on MS Windows or Mac OS X 

## Introduction ##

Ginkgo CADx is an advanced DICOM viewer and dicomizer that can
also be used to convert png, jpeg, bmp, pdf, tiff to DICOM files.

The version developed here is a continuation of the now abandoned
free version developed by MetaEmotion:

## Build ##

To build Ginkgo CADx the following software packages are required:

* ITK (>= 4.8)
* VTK (>= 6.2), Please note that the code does currently not compile with the
  VTK OpenGL2 rendering backend (see #21 and #34). VTK >= 7.0 defaults to
  this newer backend when configured without parameters, and currently
  you will have to set VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL when building VTK to
  sucessfully compile ginkgocadx. 
* wxWidgets (>= 3.0.1)
* DCMTK (>= 3.6.1-20150924)
* A C++ compiler that supports the *C++11* standard
* CMake

With these prerequisites available run *cmake* on the Ginkgo CADx
source tree and then use the selected build system to build the software.
After the software was sucessfully compiled run the install target.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


The original Ginkgo CADx implementation was done with cross-platform
compatibility in mind, i.e. the software should compile on MS Windows,
Mac OS X, and flavours of Linux. However, currently the main development
platforms are Debian GNU/Linux and Gentoo Linux using the GNU gcc compiler
tool chain. Hence incompatibilities may creep in and bug reports with fixes
for other platforms are very welcome.
